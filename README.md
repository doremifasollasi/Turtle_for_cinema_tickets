# Turtle_for_cinema_tickets
As part of the Python marathon from the GoIT company, I implemented a project to build a primitive display of a cinema on a computer screen using the Turtle library.

#The basics of working with the Turtle module
The Python Turtle module is a library that provides the ability to create graphical images using a turtle. This is a convenient way to create various geometric shapes and animations.

The Turtle module was created as a tool for teaching programming and providing interaction with a computer through visual images. With its help, you can create interesting and creative projects, as well as improve your Python programming skills.

The main components of the Turtle module are the screen and the turtle. A screen is a window in which graphic images are displayed. A turtle is an object that draws on the screen as it moves.

The Turtle module has many methods and functions that allow you to create different shapes and animations. With the help of methods, you can change the position of the turtle, its direction, the thickness and color of the lines, as well as add fill shapes.

In this project, I use the basic methods and functions of the Turtle module, which can be used to create simple and complex graphics.

More information about the Turtle module and its capabilities is available in the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).
